Welcome to the modred library!


Installation
------------

To install:
>> [sudo] python setup.py install

To run the unit tests and be sure it's working, run the following from
a directory to which you have read/write access:
>> python -c 'import modred.tests; modred.tests.run()'

To test the parallel components (requires mpi4py), do:
>> mpiexec -n 3 python -c 'import modred.tests; modred.tests.run()'

Please report test failures to bbelson@princeton.edu with the following 
information:

1. Copying the entire output of the tests
2. Python version (use python -V)
3. Numpy version (use python -c 'import numpy; print numpy.__version__')
4. Your operating system



Sphinx Documentation
--------------------

The code is primarily documented with reStructuredText docstrings which
Sphinx reads and makes pretty.

To see the documentation, currently you must build it yourself.
This is usually quite simple.

-  Get Sphinx 
    Easier way:
      easy_install sphinx
    
    Harder way:
      http://sphinx.pocoo.org/    
      python setup.py build/install
    
-  Optional, install numpydoc 
    Easier way:
      >> easy_install numpydoc
    
    Harder way:
      http://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc 
    

-  Build the documentation   
     Easier way:
       From the modred directory, run 
       >> sphinx-build doc doc/_build
       Open doc/_build/index.html in a browser to view the HTML documentation

     Harder way:
       In Makefile point to your own copy of sphinx-build, e.g.
       SPHINXBUILD   = /Users/yourname/CODES/Sphinx-1.0.6/sphinx-build.py
       From within doc/ directory 
       >> make html  (or make latex)
       Open doc/_build/index.html in a browser to view the HTML documentation



(Old) Users Guide
------------------

There is currently a user's guide in the doc directory. 
You can take a look at it for some more discussion.
However, it is out of date, may contain errors, and will eventually be
replaced by a SIAM JSC publication (in preparation).
