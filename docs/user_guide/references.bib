@article{Rowley05,
	Abstract = {Many of the tools of dynamical systems and control theory have
  gone largely unused for fluids, because the governing equations are so
  dynamically complex, both high-dimensional and nonlinear. Model reduction
  involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate the full
  high-dimensional dynamics. This paper compares three different methods of
  model reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced truncation,
  and a method called balanced POD. Balanced truncation produces better
  reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally tractable for very
  large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method for computing approximate
  balanced truncations, that has computational cost similar to POD. The method
  presented here is a variation of existing methods using empirical Gramians,
  and the main contributions of the present paper are a version of the method
  of snapshots that allows one to compute balancing transformations directly,
  without separate reduction of the Gramians; and an output projection method,
  which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs is large.
  The output projection method requires minimal additional computation, and has
  <i>a priori</i> error bounds that can guide the choice of rank of the
  projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation are also
  illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed as POD of a
  particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as an inner product. The
  three methods are illustrated on a numerical example, the linearized flow in
  a plane channel.},

@article{Shyy02,
	Abstract = {{Modeling of fluid dynamics and the associated heat transfer induced by
   plasma between two parallel electrodes is investigated. In particular,
   we consider a capacitvely coupled radio frequency discharge plasma
   generator, where the plasma is generated on the surface of a dielectric
   circuit board with electrode strips on the top and bottom. The
   electrodes have a thickness of 100 mum, which is comparable to the
   height of the boundary layer. The regime considered is that the
   electron component is in the non-equilibrium state, and the plasma is
   nonthermal. Overall, due to the ion and large fluid particle
   interaction, the pressure is higher in the downstream of the electrode,
   causing the velocity structure to resemble that of a wall jet.
   Parameters related to the electrode operation, including the voltage,
   frequency, and free stream speed are varied to investigate the
   characteristics of the plasma-induced flow. Consistent with the
   experimental observation, the model shows a clear dependence of the
   induced jet velocity on the applied voltage and frequency. The heat
   flux exhibited a similar dependence on the strength of the plasma. The
   present plasma-induced flow concept can be useful for thermal
   management and active flow control. (C) 2002 American Institute of
   Physics.}},
